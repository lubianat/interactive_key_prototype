# Open Interactive Key Prototype


A prototype for a fully open-source infrastructure for generating and sharing identification keys, with a focus on flowering plants. 

## Implemented features: 

* Fully native HTML+CSS+JSS portable, remixable, and future-proof UI
* Use a Wikibase to manage the leaf taxa x trait matrices, supporting advanced semantics + multilingual keys
* With a human-in-the loop, prepare the core taxa x trait matrix and shared the data on a publishable open-format JSON
* Enrich the leaf taxa with openly-licensed images served from Wikimedia Commons

## Future ideas 

See [the issue tracker](https://github.com/lubianat/interactive_key_prototype/issues) for more detail, but includes:

* Clarify descriptors, parsing descriptions curated on the Wikibase, also shared on specs
* Manage images for descriptors/options via Wikibase + Wikimedia Commons 
* Support a hierarchy for descriptors, allowing keys with different levels of detail
